		<h2>History of origin and development of chess </h2>

		<a class="Chessa">
			<p class="Chessp">The history of chess goes back more than one and a half thousand years. Chess was invented in India in the V-VI century BC. No later than the VI century in India appeared a game - Chaturanga, which had a recognizable chess-like appearance. Unlike chess, it was played simultaneously by 4 players, and the moves depended on the rolls of dice. To win the game it was necessary to destroy all the opponents' pieces. </p>
			<p class="Chessp">Having spread from India to neighboring countries, chaturanga underwent a number of changes. In the East it was called Chaturanga, in China it was called Xiangqi, and in Thailand it was called Makruk. In the IX-X century the game came to Europe, where the "classical" rules of the game were drawn up. The rules were finally formed in the XIX century.</p>
			<p class="Chessp">The first world chess championship was held in 1886.</p>

				<li class="Chessli">Castling - simultaneous change of position of the king and rook of the same Colour, provided that they have not moved since the beginning of the game. When castling, the king moves 2 squares towards the rook, and the rook is placed on the board between the initial and final position of the king. Castling is considered a move by the king. </li>

			<p class="Chessp"><b>Castling is impossible:</b></p>
			<li class="Chessli">If the king has already made moves in the course of the game (including a move-rocking);</li>
			<li class="Chessli">If the rook has already made a move.</li>
			<p class="Chessp"><b>The castling is temporarily impossible:</b></p>
			<li class="Chessli">If the king is checkmated, castling will result in the king passing through the beaten field or reinserting himself under check;</li>
			<li class="Chessli">If between the king and rook, intended for castling, there is another piece (his own or another's).</li>

			<h1>Winning at chess </h1>

			<p class="Chessp">Check is a situation when the king of one of the players is under the attack of an opponent's piece. In order to repel a check, one of the following actions must be performed: </p>
			<li class="Chessli">Retreat the king to any field not under attack by the opponent's pieces;</li>
			<li class="Chessli">Take the piece that threatens the king;</li>
			<li class="Chessli">Put your other piece at risk. </li>
			<p class="Chessp">Checkmate is a situation where the king is under check but cannot avoid it.</p>
			<p class="Chessp">A game is considered won if:</p> 
			<li class="Chessli">One of the players gave checkmate to the opponent's king;</li>
			<li class="Chessli">One of the players admitted defeat;</li>
			<li class="Chessli">One of the players has run out of time for moves;</li>
			<li class="Chessli">Technical victory (for example, one of the players did not come to the game).</li>

		<h1 class="Chessh1">A draw in chess</h1> 
		<a class="Chessa">
			<p class="Chessp">Pat - a situation when a player with the right of move cannot use it, because all his pieces are deprived of the opportunity to make a move. The king must not be under check. In addition, a draw is fixed in the following cases:</p> 
			<li class="Chessli">No sequence of moves leads to checkmate;</li>
			<li class="Chessli">Repeating positions three times (not necessarily for three consecutive moves) or repeating the same position five times within five consecutive moves;</li>
			<li class="Chessli">Both players made 50 moves without taking and without a pawn move (50-move rule); </li>
			<li class="Chessli">Mutual agreement to a draw.</li>
