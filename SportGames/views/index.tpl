            <p class="main_text">
                The birth of sport is attributed to the appearance of the first competitions.<br>
                The first competitions date back to the Ancient World when the first Olympic Games were held in Ancient Greece in 776 BC.<br>
                In ancient Greece, there were special places for competitions called stadiums. They were used for races for various distances, competitions in running, javelin, discus and other sports.<br>
                Over time, the Olympic Games were held every four years, and their popularity spread throughout Greece. At this time, new sports such as wrestling, fist fighting and chariot racing began to appear.<br>
                After the fall of the Roman Empire, the sport became less popular, but in the Middle Ages it began to revive again. During this period, tournaments of knights were organised, which took place on special grounds - ristalisks.<br>
                With the advent of firearms, knights' tournaments became less popular and were replaced by other sports such as archery and fencing.<br>
                Today, sport is one of the most popular activities all over the world. It helps people to maintain their health and fitness, as well as promoting team spirit and social inclusion.</p> <p>Sport is one of the most popular activities around the world.
